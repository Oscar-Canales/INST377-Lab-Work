    Sometimes you want to 
    <em>draw attention to something</em> 
    in a line of text.
    
    Sometimes you want to 
    <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong>
  in the text.
    
    Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</stong></em>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
