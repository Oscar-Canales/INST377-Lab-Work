        <em>draw attention to something</em> 
        in a line of text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to 
          <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong>
          in the text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to  
        <em><strong>do both.</strong></em>
        </div>
        
       Empty Elements Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or
    hard lines. Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft
    line breaks to match your page to the sample. Images Don't forget to use alt
    text on your images. It's important for accessibility. If you build this
    page right, your images will form a small "carousel" onigiri_1 onigiri_2
    onigiri_3 onigiri_4 Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for
    class. If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a
    "collaborator."
